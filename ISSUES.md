Vegas dollar amounts inconsistently reset:

Save game state between different game types:

Re-draw cards after loading:

Weird behaviour locking screen half way through spider deal:

Inconsistent stack moves in 40 thieves:

Move save&quit away from quit:
https://code.google.com/p/solitaire-for-android/issues/detail?id=104
Maybe just prompt to save on quit instead. Would free up more menu space too.

Add "cleanup" option to klondike:
https://code.google.com/p/solitaire-for-android/issues/detail?id=91

"Bookmark" current game state:
https://code.google.com/p/solitaire-for-android/issues/detail?id=86
I think it makes the game a bit boring, and is a little like saving state in a NES emulator.

Rounding errors in stats:
https://code.google.com/p/solitaire-for-android/issues/detail?id=82

Unable to move entire stack each time in spider:
https://code.google.com/p/solitaire-for-android/issues/detail?id=80

Undo-ing to the beginning counts as an attempt:
https://code.google.com/p/solitaire-for-android/issues/detail?id=78
I think this is expected behaviour. Otherwise each time you can't complete, you'd just undo until the beginning.

SVG Card sets:
https://code.google.com/p/solitaire-for-android/issues/detail?id=157
Switched to high res bitmaps instead.
